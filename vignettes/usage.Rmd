# Introduction

seaPiper is a user interface to studying the results of differential gene
expression analysis. Note that it does not allow any analysis per se. This
is an important distinction: the analysis results are generated using a
pipeline â€“ that allows them to be reproducible and well documented; every
analysis result can be traced back to the code that generated it, versions
of packages used to generate it etc. Analyses performed interactively (in a
graphical user interface), for example in a browser, are notoriously hard
to perform in a way that is accountable and reproducible.
