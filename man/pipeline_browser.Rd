\item{cntr}{contrasts list returned by \code{get_contrasts}}

\item{tmod_dbs}{tmod databases returned by \code{get_tmod_dbs}}

which corresponds to the primary gene identifier (including the
row names of the contrasts results in the cntr object)}

\description{
seaPiper Workflow output explorer for the sea-snap pipeline
}
\details{
Launch a shiny app for viewing / exploring the results of a differential
expression analysis performed in sea-snap.

Launching is much faster if the large objects (contrasts, tmod
databases) do not need to be loaded each time the pipeline browser is
started.
